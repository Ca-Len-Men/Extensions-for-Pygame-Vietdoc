### Before you continue, ensure you meet the following requirements
* You have installed the `pygame`, `numpy` package 📦.
* You have a basic understanding of *python syntax*, *Object Oriented Programing of python* and *pygame package* 🎮.
* You have installed the `pygamesupporter` package in this repository 🎲.

<summary><h3>About: <i>Pygame wrapper</i></h3></summary>
<br>

The `pygamesupporter` package provides a `pygame` wrapper to handle events that occur within the game. You will indirectly use `pygame` methods through classes provided by `pygamesupporter`, or use them directly on `pygame`.
- With this package, you can easily handle and manipulate mouse and keyboard events to interact with the game. Additionally, it also allows you to draw mouse cursor icons using external images or default icons.
- It provides variables related to time such as delta time and fps. This makes handling real-time events and displaying the game's FPS a breeze. In fact, you can even create your own FPS game.

<summary><h3>About: <i>Each scene in one class</i></h3></summary>
<br>

<i>Each scene in the game is written separately in a separate class</i>, making it easier for you to focus on managing a scene efficiently.<br>

Moreover, `pygamesupporter` <i>allows you to easily share data between different scenes</i>. This feature allows you <i>to reuse controls from another scene without having to create them again</i>, reducing the user's wait time when switching scenes and providing the best possible user experience.

In other words, with `pygamesupporter`, organizing and managing game scenes has never been easier ! Try it out for yourself and see the difference.

<summary><h3>About: <i>Screen concept</i></h3></summary>
<br>

As its name suggests, a `screen` object is used to display other objects, and <i>the objects inside cannot be displayed outside its display area</i>.<br>

Furthermore, a `screen` object can contain one or more other `screen` objects (a `screen` is displayed within a `screen`). This means that the application game screen is a top-level `screen` object (it is the parent of all other `screen` objects). Let's refer to this as the `screen root`, which we store in a global variable named `app` (inside the module named `base`).<br>

The simplest `Screen` type such as `app` only displays the objects it contains. The features of a screen can include reflecting back on itself (like an image reflecting under the water surface), rounding corners (objects displayed at a corner position will also be rounded because it cannot be displayed outside the area of that screen), or many other creative features.<br>

The absolute position of the mouse cursor on the root application screen (also the root screen object) is mapped to a relative position on other screen objects. This means that, for objects within a screen, the top-left corner is counted as position `(0, 0)`, but that position compared to its parent screen object may be different.

The order in which objects are displayed is to display objects in the lowest-level screens first, then display those lowest-level screens, sequentially perform operations on the parent screens, and finally update the root screen.
