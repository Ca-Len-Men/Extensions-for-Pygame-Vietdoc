<summary><h3>About: <i>Pygame wrapper</i></h3></summary>
<br>

The `pygamesupporter` package provides a `pygame` wrapper to handle events that occur within the game. You will indirectly use `pygame` methods through classes provided by `pygamesupporter`, or use them directly on `pygame`.
- With this package, you can easily handle and manipulate mouse and keyboard events to interact with the game. Additionally, it also allows you to draw mouse cursor icons using external images or default icons.
- It provides variables related to time such as delta time and fps. This makes handling real-time events and displaying the game's FPS a breeze. In fact, you can even create your own FPS game.
